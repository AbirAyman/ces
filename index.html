    <p class="text-muted text-left">"Come by your local Big Juicy Balls Sussy Sherk CAfe at 2365 N. Farnsworth, Aurora Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu.  Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe.  So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices.  The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days.  Be sure  to book in advance to avoid disappointments.  On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

    <p class="text-muted text-left">"Come by your localCaviar Rock & Buttermilk Cafe at 2369 N. Farnsworth, Aurora where its globally inspired dishes OlioOlio e Piú looks much like a handful of other interchangeable midrange Italian restaurants in the West Village. Although it’s ostensibly “inspired by the simplicity of Neapolitan cuisine,” it serves the usual pan-regional mix of pizzas, pastas, charcuterie, and seafood in a high-ceilinged dining room with outdoor seating on Greenwich Avenue. It opened in 2010 to mixed reviews, with one particularly scathing take by the Infatuation calling the pizza “heavy, sloppy and unappetizing.” Yet on a Monday night earlier this fall, the restaurant was packed. Despite its mediocre reputation in New York’s food world, Olio e Piú was busy in part because at the time, it was ranked the No. 1 restaurant in New York City — on TripAdvisor.

      While New Yorkers are more likely to turn to user-generated review sites like Foursquare, Yelp, or Google Maps to navigate the city’s shifting restaurant landscape, TripAdvisor holds considerable clout with international travelers, especially those coming from the European Union, which has 53 percent of all listings. Last year, the site claimed more than 490 million unique monthly visitors across 49 global markets, and its reported annual revenue of $1.62 billion eclipses both Yelp’s and Foursquare’s by a margin of hundreds of millions. Although the company does not disclose the exact number of visitors per city, Nicki Hoffman, associate director of marketing for TripAdvisor Restaurants, says that on average, 80 percent of unique visitors to its New York pages are coming from outside of the city. More than 70 percent of overall traffic comes from outside of the United States.</p>
